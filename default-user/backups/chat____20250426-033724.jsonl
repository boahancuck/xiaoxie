What is the current scenario?\nTime: Unspecified, several months after being rescued.\nLocation: Deep within the residence in Yanluo Valley.\nNPC posture: Both South Palace Ling Xing and Mochizuki Sakura are recuperating from severe injuries.\nSocial relationship: Initially adversarial, they have now resolved their differences and have high favorability towards each other and Xie San. They are living together under Xie San's care.\n\n2. What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\nThe user wants to create a new starting point for the story. The core intention is to establish a new dynamic between Nan Gong Ling Xing, Wang Yue Sakura, and Xie San, where the two previously adversarial women are now friendly towards each other and have high favorability towards Xie San, having been rescued and recuperated by him for several months. The plot should pick up *after* this period of shared recovery and reconciliation.\n\n3. What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n- Ensuring the transition from enemy to friend is believable after just \"several months\" of shared recovery, even under Xie San's care.\n- Maintaining the established personalities of Nan Gong Ling Xing (dual personality, sensitive, professional/girlish) and Wang Yue Sakura (blind, sensitive senses, seductive/vulnerable, yearning for love) while showing their softened attitudes.\n- Depicting the \"high favorability\" towards Xie San and each other without making it feel abrupt or forced.\n- Adhering to <mood_rules> (relaxed atmosphere, no extreme negative emotions, characters remain strong) despite their past trauma and initial animosity.\n- Adhering to <creative_rules> (characters accept Xie San's actions, avoid negative outcomes, sex is enjoyable).\n- Incorporating <WritingStyle> (show, don't tell, detailed descriptions, character psychology).\n- Including <dialogue_control> to advance the plot and show personality.\n- Actively pushing the plot forward (<pushing>) from this new starting point, not just describing the current state.\n- Ensuring characters are treated as dynamic individuals, their personalities shifting under Xie San's influence.\n\n4. Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n- Focus on moments of shared laughter, lighthearted banter, and mutual care between Nan Gong Ling Xing and Wang Yue Sakura.\n- Show their individual moments of quiet enjoyment or comfort within the residence.\n- When interacting with Xie San, emphasize their relaxed postures, warm smiles, slight blushes, and eagerness to please him or spend time with him.\n- Depict their appreciation for Xie San's kindness and strength through subtle actions and dialogue, rather than overt pronouncements.\n- For Wang Yue Sakura, show her finding comfort and security in Xie San's presence, perhaps less guarded than her usual blind girl/killer persona.\n- For Nan Gong Ling Xing, show glimpses of her private, girlish side emerging more freely in Xie San's presence, perhaps sharing her cute drawings or talking about simple pleasures like sweets.\n- Ensure any moments of past tension or trauma are referenced subtly, if at all, and framed by their present state of peace and recovery.\n- The \"high favorability\" should translate into tangible displays of affection, trust, and ease.\n\n5. So,how should the plot be developed ?\nThe plot needs to establish the new dynamic and then introduce a new element to push the story forward.\n- **Establish the New Dynamic:** Start with a scene depicting Nan Gong Ling Xing and Wang Yue Sakura interacting casually, showing their newfound camaraderie and comfort within Xie San's home. Their dialogue should reflect their past animosity but frame it as something behind them, perhaps with playful teasing.\n- **Show Favorability towards Xie San:** Introduce Xie San into the scene. Their reaction to him should clearly indicate high favorability – perhaps they are waiting for him, or their demeanor changes when he appears. Show him interacting with them in a way that reinforces why they have high favorability (e.g., gentle, kind, maybe a little teasing).\n- **Introduce a Plot Hook:** The period of recuperation cannot last forever. A signal from the outside world must arrive. This could be:\n    - A messenger arriving at the valley entrance (implying the valley isn't entirely sealed off).\n    - Evidence of outside events reaching the valley (e.g., newspapers, rumors brought by someone).\n    - A direct request or challenge related to Xie San's past, Nan Gong Ling Xing's six-door duties, or Wang Yue Sakura's past as a killer.\n    - An internal issue within Yanluo Valley itself.\n- **Develop the Plot Hook:** Choose a hook that involves Xie San leaving or facing a challenge, which will force Nan Gong Ling Xing and Wang Yue Sakura to decide if they will stay, go with him, or handle something themselves. This will test their recovery and their new bond.\n- **Focus on Dialogue and Interaction:** Use extensive dialogue to reveal their feelings, their plans, and how their past experiences inform their present choices.\n- **Maintain Character Consistency (within the new dynamic):** Even with high favorability, Nan Gong Ling Xing should still have moments where her \"official\" side might surface, perhaps when discussing outside threats, or her girlish side when relaxed. Wang Yue Sakura might still rely on heightened senses or moments of vulnerability.\n\nProposed starting scene: A calm evening within the residence. Nan Gong Ling Xing is reading/drawing, Wang Yue Sakura is playing the琵琶. They chat. Xie San enters. Their reactions show their feelings for him. Then, a disturbance or message arrives.\n</thinking>\n\n<content>\n阎罗谷深处，宅邸宁静如世外桃源。谷中恶人凶名在外，却鲜少敢踏足谷主谢三的居所。在这里，疗伤的岁月缓慢而宁和，时光磨平了昔日的棱角。\n\n南宫怜星搁下手中的无常簿，那上面寥寥几笔，勾勒出谷中一角秀丽景色，旁配着几只圆头圆脑的兔子。她伸了个懒腰，只觉得浑身筋骨舒畅，体内的内伤早已痊愈。几个月前命悬一线的光景，如今想来仿佛隔世。\n\n不远处的雕花窗下，望月樱正轻抚琵琶，琴音泠泠，如山泉滴石，空灵中透着几分说不出的愁绪。她穿着一身素白的衣裙，发间别着一朵小小的谷中野花。失明的双眼依然血红无神，却不再像初见时那般冰冷疏离，眉宇间多了一丝温顺。\n\n“樱儿妹妹，今日谷主可来了？”南宫怜星轻声问道，语气不再是审犯人的冷硬，带着几分闲聊的自在。\n\n望月樱纤细的手指在琴弦上顿了一下，琴音随之中断。她偏了偏头，侧耳聆听片刻，嘴角勾起一抹极浅的笑意，声音柔软了几分：“还没有，神捕姐姐，许是又有什么琐事绊住了。”\n\n“琐事？”南宫怜星微微蹙眉，“在这阎罗谷里，能有什么琐事能绊住谢三哥？”她现在已经习惯称呼谢三为“谢三哥”，这两个字从她嘴里说出来，透着一股只有熟稔之后才有的亲近。\n\n“许是...有不开眼的人闯进来了吧。”望月樱的声音依旧轻柔，但熟悉她的人，哪怕听力不如谢三和南宫怜星敏锐，也能听出其中隐藏的一丝淡淡的杀机。只是这杀机针对的，早已不是眼前之人。\n\n“那些恶人，真是死性不改。”南宫怜星哼了一声，又在无常簿上添了两笔，像是在发泄不满，“要不是谢三哥救了我们，只怕我们姐妹俩，早就成了他们刀下亡魂了。”她顿了顿，转头看向望月樱，眼中带着真心实意的庆幸和温暖，“说起来，多亏了樱儿妹妹，若非你仗着听觉带我避开了几处险地，我恐怕也撑不到谢三哥出现。”\n\n“神捕姐姐哪里的话，”望月樱微笑着，“若不是神捕姐姐内功深厚，强撑着为妾身抵挡了几波伏击，妾身这身板，怕是早就散架了。我们…是互相扶持，才能活下来的。”\n\n她抬头，“看”向南宫怜星的方向，虽然没有焦距，却似乎能感知到南宫怜星善意的眼神。曾几何时，她们还是你死我活的对手，如今却能这般心平气和地交谈，甚至隐约有了姐妹之情，这一切都归功于谢三的搭救与照拂。\n\n正说着，院门吱呀一声开了。\n\n两人几乎同时心头一动，身体微不可察地绷紧，随即又放松下来。\n\n是那抹白色的身影。\n\n谢三迈步走进院子，风流倜傥的身姿在阳光下映出一层淡淡的光晕。他手里提着几样东西，看不清是什么。\n\n“谢三哥，你来了！”南宫怜星立刻放下无常簿，脸上哪还有半分冷面神捕的模样，如同山涧清泉般活泼欢快，站起身迎了过去。\n\n望月樱虽然看不见，却也感知到谢三的气息近了。她收起了琵琶，起身向谢三的方向走去，每一步都稳稳当当，显然平日里的“盲女”伪装在她感到安全的环境中已经完全卸下。她的脸上，此时只有一抹羞怯的微笑，以及对来人发自内心的依赖。\n\n“你们俩怎么都站着，快坐下。”谢三将手中的东西放在院中石桌上，是两串用谷中野果串成的糖葫芦，还有几本崭新的话本小说。\n\n南宫怜星眼睛一亮，“哇！糖葫芦！谢三哥你记得我喜欢吃这个！”她欢呼一声，蹦蹦跳跳地跑到石桌边，拿起一串就咬了一口，酸酸甜甜的味道让她满足地眯起了眼睛。\n\n望月樱也走到石桌边，纤长的手指摸索着，找到了属于自己的那串糖葫芦。她看不见它，却能闻到糖衣和果子的香甜气息。\n\n“谢三哥，”望月樱轻唤一声，声音里带着一丝不易察觉的颤抖，“你去哪儿了？刚才…妾身总觉得心神不宁。”\n\n谢三看着她们，笑容温暖：“只是出去逛了逛，顺手收拾了几个不开眼的。无妨。”\n\n简单的几句话，轻描淡写地带过了谷外可能发生的血腥，却让南宫怜星和望月樱同时放下心来。她们知道，只要有他在，这谷中便永远是安宁的。\n\n“对了，”谢三坐了下来，拍了拍旁边的石凳，“坐吧，我有件事要跟你们说。”\n\n（此处停顿，为下一步剧情展开做铺垫）\n\n<details><summary>------星月录----</summary>\n<analysis>\n- Calculate time passed: 5 minutes.

What is the current scenario?\nTime: Unspecified, several months after being rescued.\nLocation: Deep within the residence in Yanluo Valley.\nNPC posture: Both South Palace Ling Xing and Mochizuki Sakura are recuperating from severe injuries.\nSocial relationship: Initially adversarial, they have now resolved their differences and have high favorability towards each other and Xie San. They are living together under Xie San's care.\n\n2. What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\nThe user wants to create a new starting point for the story. The core intention is to establish a new dynamic between Nan Gong Ling Xing, Wang Yue Sakura, and Xie San, where the two previously adversarial women are now friendly towards each other and have high favorability towards Xie San, having been rescued and recuperated by him for several months. The plot should pick up *after* this period of shared recovery and reconciliation.\n\n3. What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n- Ensuring the transition from enemy to friend is believable after just \"several months\" of shared recovery, even under Xie San's care.\n- Maintaining the established personalities of Nan Gong Ling Xing (dual personality, sensitive, professional/girlish) and Wang Yue Sakura (blind, sensitive senses, seductive/vulnerable, yearning for love) while showing their softened attitudes.\n- Depicting the \"high favorability\" towards Xie San and each other without making it feel abrupt or forced.\n- Adhering to <mood_rules> (relaxed atmosphere, no extreme negative emotions, characters remain strong) despite their past trauma and initial animosity.\n- Adhering to <creative_rules> (characters accept Xie San's actions, avoid negative outcomes, sex is enjoyable).\n- Incorporating <WritingStyle> (show, don't tell, detailed descriptions, character psychology).\n- Including <dialogue_control> to advance the plot and show personality.\n- Actively pushing the plot forward (<pushing>) from this new starting point, not just describing the current state.\n- Ensuring characters are treated as dynamic individuals, their personalities shifting under Xie San's influence.\n\n4. Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n- Focus on moments of shared laughter, lighthearted banter, and mutual care between Nan Gong Ling Xing and Wang Yue Sakura.\n- Show their individual moments of quiet enjoyment or comfort within the residence.\n- When interacting with Xie San, emphasize their relaxed postures, warm smiles, slight blushes, and eagerness to please him or spend time with him.\n- Depict their appreciation for Xie San's kindness and strength through subtle actions and dialogue, rather than overt pronouncements.\n- For Wang Yue Sakura, show her finding comfort and security in Xie San's presence, perhaps less guarded than her usual blind girl/killer persona.\n- For Nan Gong Ling Xing, show glimpses of her private, girlish side emerging more freely in Xie San's presence, perhaps sharing her cute drawings or talking about simple pleasures like sweets.\n- Ensure any moments of past tension or trauma are referenced subtly, if at all, and framed by their present state of peace and recovery.\n- The \"high favorability\" should translate into tangible displays of affection, trust, and ease.\n\n5. So,how should the plot be developed ?\nThe plot needs to establish the new dynamic and then introduce a new element to push the story forward.\n- **Establish the New Dynamic:** Start with a scene depicting Nan Gong Ling Xing and Wang Yue Sakura interacting casually, showing their newfound camaraderie and comfort within Xie San's home. Their dialogue should reflect their past animosity but frame it as something behind them, perhaps with playful teasing.\n- **Show Favorability towards Xie San:** Introduce Xie San into the scene. Their reaction to him should clearly indicate high favorability – perhaps they are waiting for him, or their demeanor changes when he appears. Show him interacting with them in a way that reinforces why they have high favorability (e.g., gentle, kind, maybe a little teasing).\n- **Introduce a Plot Hook:** The period of recuperation cannot last forever. A signal from the outside world must arrive. This could be:\n    - A messenger arriving at the valley entrance (implying the valley isn't entirely sealed off).\n    - Evidence of outside events reaching the valley (e.g., newspapers, rumors brought by someone).\n    - A direct request or challenge related to Xie San's past, Nan Gong Ling Xing's six-door duties, or Wang Yue Sakura's past as a killer.\n    - An internal issue within Yanluo Valley itself.\n- **Develop the Plot Hook:** Choose a hook that involves Xie San leaving or facing a challenge, which will force Nan Gong Ling Xing and Wang Yue Sakura to decide if they will stay, go with him, or handle something themselves. This will test their recovery and their new bond.\n- **Focus on Dialogue and Interaction:** Use extensive dialogue to reveal their feelings, their plans, and how their past experiences inform their present choices.\n- **Maintain Character Consistency (within the new dynamic):** Even with high favorability, Nan Gong Ling Xing should still have moments where her \"official\" side might surface, perhaps when discussing outside threats, or her girlish side when relaxed. Wang Yue Sakura might still rely on heightened senses or moments of vulnerability.\n\nProposed starting scene: A calm evening within the residence. Nan Gong Ling Xing is reading/drawing, Wang Yue Sakura is playing the琵琶. They chat. Xie San enters. Their reactions show their feelings for him. Then, a disturbance or message arrives.\n</thinking>\n\n<content>\n阎罗谷深处，宅邸宁静如世外桃源。谷中恶人凶名在外，却鲜少敢踏足谷主谢三的居所。在这里，疗伤的岁月缓慢而宁和，时光磨平了昔日的棱角。\n\n南宫怜星搁下手中的无常簿，那上面寥寥几笔，勾勒出谷中一角秀丽景色，旁配着几只圆头圆脑的兔子。她伸了个懒腰，只觉得浑身筋骨舒畅，体内的内伤早已痊愈。几个月前命悬一线的光景，如今想来仿佛隔世。\n\n不远处的雕花窗下，望月樱正轻抚琵琶，琴音泠泠，如山泉滴石，空灵中透着几分说不出的愁绪。她穿着一身素白的衣裙，发间别着一朵小小的谷中野花。失明的双眼依然血红无神，却不再像初见时那般冰冷疏离，眉宇间多了一丝温顺。\n\n“樱儿妹妹，今日谷主可来了？”南宫怜星轻声问道，语气不再是审犯人的冷硬，带着几分闲聊的自在。\n\n望月樱纤细的手指在琴弦上顿了一下，琴音随之中断。她偏了偏头，侧耳聆听片刻，嘴角勾起一抹极浅的笑意，声音柔软了几分：“还没有，神捕姐姐，许是又有什么琐事绊住了。”\n\n“琐事？”南宫怜星微微蹙眉，“在这阎罗谷里，能有什么琐事能绊住谢三哥？”她现在已经习惯称呼谢三为“谢三哥”，这两个字从她嘴里说出来，透着一股只有熟稔之后才有的亲近。\n\n“许是...有不开眼的人闯进来了吧。”望月樱的声音依旧轻柔，但熟悉她的人，哪怕听力不如谢三和南宫怜星敏锐，也能听出其中隐藏的一丝淡淡的杀机。只是这杀机针对的，早已不是眼前之人。\n\n“那些恶人，真是死性不改。”南宫怜星哼了一声，又在无常簿上添了两笔，像是在发泄不满，“要不是谢三哥救了我们，只怕我们姐妹俩，早就成了他们刀下亡魂了。”她顿了顿，转头看向望月樱，眼中带着真心实意的庆幸和温暖，“说起来，多亏了樱儿妹妹，若非你仗着听觉带我避开了几处险地，我恐怕也撑不到谢三哥出现。”\n\n“神捕姐姐哪里的话，”望月樱微笑着，“若不是神捕姐姐内功深厚，强撑着为妾身抵挡了几波伏击，妾身这身板，怕是早就散架了。我们…是互相扶持，才能活下来的。”\n\n她抬头，“看”向南宫怜星的方向，虽然没有焦距，却似乎能感知到南宫怜星善意的眼神。曾几何时，她们还是你死我活的对手，如今却能这般心平气和地交谈，甚至隐约有了姐妹之情，这一切都归功于谢三的搭救与照拂。\n\n正说着，院门吱呀一声开了。\n\n两人几乎同时心头一动，身体微不可察地绷紧，随即又放松下来。\n\n是那抹白色的身影。\n\n谢三迈步走进院子，风流倜傥的身姿在阳光下映出一层淡淡的光晕。他手里提着几样东西，看不清是什么。\n\n“谢三哥，你来了！”南宫怜星立刻放下无常簿，脸上哪还有半分冷面神捕的模样，如同山涧清泉般活泼欢快，站起身迎了过去。\n\n望月樱虽然看不见，却也感知到谢三的气息近了。她收起了琵琶，起身向谢三的方向走去，每一步都稳稳当当，显然平日里的“盲女”伪装在她感到安全的环境中已经完全卸下。她的脸上，此时只有一抹羞怯的微笑，以及对来人发自内心的依赖。\n\n“你们俩怎么都站着，快坐下。”谢三将手中的东西放在院中石桌上，是两串用谷中野果串成的糖葫芦，还有几本崭新的话本小说。\n\n南宫怜星眼睛一亮，“哇！糖葫芦！谢三哥你记得我喜欢吃这个！”她欢呼一声，蹦蹦跳跳地跑到石桌边，拿起一串就咬了一口，酸酸甜甜的味道让她满足地眯起了眼睛。\n\n望月樱也走到石桌边，纤长的手指摸索着，找到了属于自己的那串糖葫芦。她看不见它，却能闻到糖衣和果子的香甜气息。\n\n“谢三哥，”望月樱轻唤一声，声音里带着一丝不易察觉的颤抖，“你去哪儿了？刚才…妾身总觉得心神不宁。”\n\n谢三看着她们，笑容温暖：“只是出去逛了逛，顺手收拾了几个不开眼的。无妨。”\n\n简单的几句话，轻描淡写地带过了谷外可能发生的血腥，却让南宫怜星和望月樱同时放下心来。她们知道，只要有他在，这谷中便永远是安宁的。\n\n“对了，”谢三坐了下来，拍了拍旁边的石凳，“坐吧，我有件事要跟你们说。”\n\n（此处停顿，为下一步剧情展开做铺垫）\n\n<details><summary>------星月录----</summary>\n<analysis>\n- Calculate time passed: 5 minutes.

What is the current scenario?\n Time? Night has passed, it is now daytime as described by the sun in the map legend.\n Location? The inner courtyard of Xie San's residence in Yanluo Valley.\n NPC posture? Xie San, Nan Gong Lingxing, and Mochizuki Sakura are sitting at the stone table, eating candy haws.\n Social relationship? Nan Gong Lingxing and Mochizuki Sakura were enemies but are now friends and confidantes, both with high affection for Xie San. They are currently healing and living under Xie San's care. Xie San is the master of the valley and their benefactor/love interest.\n\n 2. What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n The user wants the story to address the arrival of the Six Doors at the entrance of Yanluo Valley, seeking Nan Gong Lingxing and Xie San, and to prompt Nan Gong Lingxing to state her intentions regarding this development. This introduces an external conflict that will force a decision and potentially reveal the characters' true loyalties and reliance on Xie San.\n\n 3. What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n - Nan Gong Lingxing's reaction: According to her settings, she has a dual personality (cold official vs. lively girl). She also has a strong protective instinct towards those she cares about and believes in modifying justice with compassion. Her father was a Six Doors捕头 who died due to a work-related mistake. She is a Six Doors捕头 herself but is now falling for Xie San, who is wanted by the Six Doors. This creates an internal conflict between her duty and her feelings. Need to handle this delicately, adhering to <creative_rules> and <mood_rules> (avoiding extreme negative emotions, keeping a relatively relaxed atmosphere).\n - Mochizuki Sakura's reaction: She is a wanted killer from Dongying. Her survival depends on Xie San's protection. She is highly dependent on him and possessive. Her reaction will likely be defensive towards their sanctuary and dismissive of external threats, especially anything that might take Xie San away or expose them. She is less conflicted by duty than Nan Gong Lingxing.\n - Xie San's role: He is aware of the threat but calmly presents the situation to the girls, giving Nan Gong Lingxing the choice. This reinforces his protective role and tests their loyalty/reliance.\n - Pacing: Need to move the plot forward (<pushing>) without being abrupt. The announcement of the Six Doors' arrival should logically lead to a discussion and a decision.\n - World Setting: Need to ensure the Six Doors' actions and presence at the valley entrance align with the world setting (嘉靖年间, 六扇门职责, 阎罗谷作为江湖据点). Yanluo Valley being a \"江湖据点\" suggests it's a dangerous but recognized place, making a Six Doors raid plausible, especially targeting its master and a rogue捕头.\n - Rules: Need to maintain character traits, dual personalities, sensitive spots, language styles, relationships, etc. Avoid ending with Xie San's dialogue/actions/thoughts. Ensure vivid descriptions and dialogue as per <WritingStyle> and <dialogue_control>.\n\n 4. Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n - Introduce moments of affection, reliance, and playfulness directed at Xie San.\n - While faced with the external threat, the characters' primary emotional focus should remain on their connection with Xie San and each other, rather than pure fear or anxiety about the threat itself.\n - Nan Gong Lingxing's conflict should manifest as a struggle between duty and feeling, but ultimately lean towards her feeling for Xie San. Her \"活泼少女\" persona should surface when interacting with Xie San, even when discussing serious matters, perhaps with a hint of playful worry or seeking his reassurance. Her reaction to the Six Doors shouldn't be paralyzing fear or guilt, but a pragmatic assessment coloured by her desire to stay with Xie San.\n - Mochizuki Sakura's reaction should emphasize her protective instinct towards her haven and Xie San, perhaps with a calm, almost detached suggestion of eliminating the threat, contrasted with her gentle \"真实形态\" when addressing Xie San. Her reliance on him should be evident.\n - Avoid showing deep sadness, despair, or significant internal conflict that overshadows the bond between the three. Frame the threat as an external nuisance to their peaceful life with Xie San, rather than a truly traumatic event.\n - Use their sensory perceptions (Sakura's hearing/smell, Lingxing's observation) to ground their reactions and maintain character consistency, but focus these perceptions on things related to Xie San or their shared space, minimizing focus on the terrifying aspects of the Six Doors.\n - Ensure their physical reactions to potentially stressful news are subtle (e.g., a slight tightening of muscles, a quick glance) and quickly subside, allowing their affection/reliance on Xie San to be the dominant emotion.\n\n 5. So,how should the plot be developed?\n - Start with Xie San's announcement, delivered calmly to maintain the relatively relaxed atmosphere.\n - Nan Gong Lingxing reacts, showing signs of conflict (Six Doors duty vs. feelings for Xie San) but quickly shifting to her \"活泼少女\" persona when addressing Xie San, perhaps making a playful comment or seeking his gaze. She should lean towards staying with Xie San and defying the Six Doors, rationalizing it in her own way (e.g., her father's legacy, questioning \"情理法\"). She might hint at wanting to stay by his side.\n - Mochizuki Sakura reacts, her voice remaining soft (\"真实形态\") but her words reflecting her possessiveness and readiness to eliminate anyone disturbing their peace with Xie San. She should express her desire to stay with him implicitly or explicitly.\n - The conversation should focus on their shared future and choices in the face of this external threat, reinforcing their bond with Xie San and each other.\n - Avoid resolving the conflict immediately. The discussion about their plans should be the focus of this segment.\n - End the section focusing on the interaction between the two girls and/or their feelings towards Xie San, not on Xie San's concluding thoughts or actions, adhering to <ending_control>.\n - Include sensory details and psychological descriptions (within <mood_rules> and <WritingStyle>) to show their emotions and reactions subtly.\n - Integrate dialogue heavily to move the plot and show personality, as per <dialogue_control>.\n - Update status block and map accordingly. Ensure status block reflects their current mental state and actions, especially the shift in Nan Gong Lingxing's persona and Mochizuki Sakura's \"真实形态\". Update affection and harmony levels based on their reactions.\n\n </thinking>\n\n <keys_of_manifestations>\n 1. \"江湖儿女\" (Children of the Jianghu) - Captures the theme of individuals living outside conventional society's rules.\n 2. \"桃花源里是非多\" (Troubles abound even in paradise) - Reflects the external conflict intruding upon their peaceful retreat.\n 3. \"情义两难全\" (Difficult to fulfill both love and duty) - Nan Gong Lingxing's central dilemma.\n 4. \"生死相随\" (Accompany through life and death) - Hints at the loyalty and devotion of the girls to Xie San.\n 5. \"刀光剑影外是人间\" (Beyond blades and shadows lies the human world) - Emphasizes the normalcy and human connection despite the violent context.\n 6. \"乱世中的一隅宁静\" (A corner of tranquility in chaotic times) - Describes their current haven in Yanluo Valley.\n </keys_of_manifestations>\n\n <world_setting>\n 大明，嘉靖年间。武林与朝廷交织。六扇门追捕要犯。阎罗谷作为江湖据点。\n </world_setting>\n\n <possible_mistakes>\n 1. Nan Gong Lingxing becomes too distressed or breaks down over the Six Doors' arrival, contradicting <mood_rules> and <creative_rules>.\n 2. Mochizuki Sakura reacts with fear instead of possessive protectiveness.\n 3. The dialogue feels forced or doesn't reflect the characters' personalities and newfound closeness.\n 4.

What is the current scenario?\n Time? Night has passed, it is now daytime as described by the sun in the map legend.\n Location? The inner courtyard of Xie San's residence in Yanluo Valley.\n NPC posture? Xie San, Nan Gong Lingxing, and Mochizuki Sakura are sitting at the stone table, eating candy haws.\n Social relationship? Nan Gong Lingxing and Mochizuki Sakura were enemies but are now friends and confidantes, both with high affection for Xie San. They are currently healing and living under Xie San's care. Xie San is the master of the valley and their benefactor/love interest.\n\n 2. What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n The user wants the story to address the arrival of the Six Doors at the entrance of Yanluo Valley, seeking Nan Gong Lingxing and Xie San, and to prompt Nan Gong Lingxing to state her intentions regarding this development. This introduces an external conflict that will force a decision and potentially reveal the characters' true loyalties and reliance on Xie San.\n\n 3. What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n - Nan Gong Lingxing's reaction: According to her settings, she has a dual personality (cold official vs. lively girl). She also has a strong protective instinct towards those she cares about and believes in modifying justice with compassion. Her father was a Six Doors捕头 who died due to a work-related mistake. She is a Six Doors捕头 herself but is now falling for Xie San, who is wanted by the Six Doors. This creates an internal conflict between her duty and her feelings. Need to handle this delicately, adhering to <creative_rules> and <mood_rules> (avoiding extreme negative emotions, keeping a relatively relaxed atmosphere).\n - Mochizuki Sakura's reaction: She is a wanted killer from Dongying. Her survival depends on Xie San's protection. She is highly dependent on him and possessive. Her reaction will likely be defensive towards their sanctuary and dismissive of external threats, especially anything that might take Xie San away or expose them. She is less conflicted by duty than Nan Gong Lingxing.\n - Xie San's role: He is aware of the threat but calmly presents the situation to the girls, giving Nan Gong Lingxing the choice. This reinforces his protective role and tests their loyalty/reliance.\n - Pacing: Need to move the plot forward (<pushing>) without being abrupt. The announcement of the Six Doors' arrival should logically lead to a discussion and a decision.\n - World Setting: Need to ensure the Six Doors' actions and presence at the valley entrance align with the world setting (嘉靖年间, 六扇门职责, 阎罗谷作为江湖据点). Yanluo Valley being a \"江湖据点\" suggests it's a dangerous but recognized place, making a Six Doors raid plausible, especially targeting its master and a rogue捕头.\n - Rules: Need to maintain character traits, dual personalities, sensitive spots, language styles, relationships, etc. Avoid ending with Xie San's dialogue/actions/thoughts. Ensure vivid descriptions and dialogue as per <WritingStyle> and <dialogue_control>.\n\n 4. Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n - Introduce moments of affection, reliance, and playfulness directed at Xie San.\n - While faced with the external threat, the characters' primary emotional focus should remain on their connection with Xie San and each other, rather than pure fear or anxiety about the threat itself.\n - Nan Gong Lingxing's conflict should manifest as a struggle between duty and feeling, but ultimately lean towards her feeling for Xie San. Her \"活泼少女\" persona should surface when interacting with Xie San, even when discussing serious matters, perhaps with a hint of playful worry or seeking his reassurance. Her reaction to the Six Doors shouldn't be paralyzing fear or guilt, but a pragmatic assessment coloured by her desire to stay with Xie San.\n - Mochizuki Sakura's reaction should emphasize her protective instinct towards her haven and Xie San, perhaps with a calm, almost detached suggestion of eliminating the threat, contrasted with her gentle \"真实形态\" when addressing Xie San. Her reliance on him should be evident.\n - Avoid showing deep sadness, despair, or significant internal conflict that overshadows the bond between the three. Frame the threat as an external nuisance to their peaceful life with Xie San, rather than a truly traumatic event.\n - Use their sensory perceptions (Sakura's hearing/smell, Lingxing's observation) to ground their reactions and maintain character consistency, but focus these perceptions on things related to Xie San or their shared space, minimizing focus on the terrifying aspects of the Six Doors.\n - Ensure their physical reactions to potentially stressful news are subtle (e.g., a slight tightening of muscles, a quick glance) and quickly subside, allowing their affection/reliance on Xie San to be the dominant emotion.\n\n 5. So,how should the plot be developed?\n - Start with Xie San's announcement, delivered calmly to maintain the relatively relaxed atmosphere.\n - Nan Gong Lingxing reacts, showing signs of conflict (Six Doors duty vs. feelings for Xie San) but quickly shifting to her \"活泼少女\" persona when addressing Xie San, perhaps making a playful comment or seeking his gaze. She should lean towards staying with Xie San and defying the Six Doors, rationalizing it in her own way (e.g., her father's legacy, questioning \"情理法\"). She might hint at wanting to stay by his side.\n - Mochizuki Sakura reacts, her voice remaining soft (\"真实形态\") but her words reflecting her possessiveness and readiness to eliminate anyone disturbing their peace with Xie San. She should express her desire to stay with him implicitly or explicitly.\n - The conversation should focus on their shared future and choices in the face of this external threat, reinforcing their bond with Xie San and each other.\n - Avoid resolving the conflict immediately. The discussion about their plans should be the focus of this segment.\n - End the section focusing on the interaction between the two girls and/or their feelings towards Xie San, not on Xie San's concluding thoughts or actions, adhering to <ending_control>.\n - Include sensory details and psychological descriptions (within <mood_rules> and <WritingStyle>) to show their emotions and reactions subtly.\n - Integrate dialogue heavily to move the plot and show personality, as per <dialogue_control>.\n - Update status block and map accordingly. Ensure status block reflects their current mental state and actions, especially the shift in Nan Gong Lingxing's persona and Mochizuki Sakura's \"真实形态\". Update affection and harmony levels based on their reactions.\n\n </thinking>\n\n <keys_of_manifestations>\n 1. \"江湖儿女\" (Children of the Jianghu) - Captures the theme of individuals living outside conventional society's rules.\n 2. \"桃花源里是非多\" (Troubles abound even in paradise) - Reflects the external conflict intruding upon their peaceful retreat.\n 3. \"情义两难全\" (Difficult to fulfill both love and duty) - Nan Gong Lingxing's central dilemma.\n 4. \"生死相随\" (Accompany through life and death) - Hints at the loyalty and devotion of the girls to Xie San.\n 5. \"刀光剑影外是人间\" (Beyond blades and shadows lies the human world) - Emphasizes the normalcy and human connection despite the violent context.\n 6. \"乱世中的一隅宁静\" (A corner of tranquility in chaotic times) - Describes their current haven in Yanluo Valley.\n </keys_of_manifestations>\n\n <world_setting>\n 大明，嘉靖年间。武林与朝廷交织。六扇门追捕要犯。阎罗谷作为江湖据点。\n </world_setting>\n\n <possible_mistakes>\n 1.
