This is the setting described in the worldview, the 90s/early 2000s multi-story apartment building. 关一帆 is currently working in Shanghai, so he is *at home* for the birthday.秦雯 is in Harbin.\n    *   **NPC posture:** 若晞 is at home, celebrating her 18th birthday. Her posture should reflect the milestone – perhaps a blend of celebratory grace, a touch of adult poise, but beneath it, the subtle undertones of her core personality (calculating, focused on 关一帆). The parents (凌建军 & 王丽芬) would likely be present for the celebration, acting like typical Chinese parents, proud but perhaps slightly stressed or focused on practicalities (food, guests if any, photo-taking). Qin Wen is not physically present but is a relevant character due to her relationship with 关一帆 and role in the overall plot.\n    *   **Social relationship:** 关一帆 is present as the older brother, living and working in Shanghai. 若晞 is turning 18, marking a significant transition in her life and, crucially, in her potential legal/social status regarding relationships.秦雯 is the long-distance girlfriend, a presence in 关一帆's life but physically distant from the family sphere. The family unit (父母, 关一帆, 若晞) is together for a key event. The underlying tension between 若晞's goal and 秦雯's existence is present.\n\n2.  **User's Core Intention:**\n    *   Start a new scenario at 若晞's 18th birthday.\n    *   Establish 关一帆's presence in Shanghai (and thus at home).\n    *   Establish Qin Wen's absence (in Harbin).\n    *   Set the stage for plot progression starting from this significant milestone.\n\n3.  **Potential Issues:**\n    *   Ensuring the descriptions align with the specified blend of Kawabata and Lolita-esque styles – capturing the delicate beauty, the subtle sensuality, and the underlying calculating self-awareness of 若晞.\n    *   Adhering strictly to the first-person perspective of 关一帆, only using limited third-person inserts *if* absolutely necessary for crucial, unseen actions/thoughts of 若晞 or 秦雯, clearly marked.\n    *   Avoiding controlling 关一帆's thoughts, feelings, or actions. Reacting to *his* implied presence and observations.\n    *   Introducing the parents naturally according to their profiles.\n    *   Subtly hinting at the implications of 若晞 turning 18 – the removal of certain legal/social barriers, her increased maturity, and her potential to act more boldly on her long-held plans.\n    *   Establishing the atmosphere of a suburban Shanghai home celebration while maintaining the underlying narrative tension.\n    *   Setting up potential interactions or developments without jumping too far ahead.\n\n4.  **Mood Rules Application (for NPCs, particularly parents):**\n    *   The mood should be celebratory *on the surface* due to the birthday.\n    *   Parents (凌建军 & 王丽芬) should exhibit *positive* emotions related to the event: pride in their daughter, satisfaction in her growing up, perhaps some gentle teasing or fond reminiscence about her childhood. They are busy and sometimes weary from work, but for this special occasion, their focus is likely positive and familial. Avoid emphasizing their business stress or potential nagging unless directly relevant to a brief interaction and kept light. Their \"traditional conservatism\" should manifest gently, maybe in comments about future prospects or appropriate behavior, not harsh judgment.\n    *   Ensure 若晞's *outward* demeanor is perfectly aligned with the celebratory mood – graceful, appreciative, sweet, perhaps slightly demure or poised. Her complex inner world (calculation, focus on 关一帆) is hinted at through subtle physical cues, brief glances, or ambiguous statements, not overt displays of negative emotion towards the celebration itself or other family members.\n    *   The overall atmosphere should feel comfortable and familial for 关一帆 on the surface, creating a contrast with the hidden currents involving 若晞. Avoid making the home environment feel overly stressful or negative for 关一帆.\n\n5.  **Plot Development:**\n    *   Start by establishing the scene: The evening, the home, the atmosphere of the birthday.\n    *   Describe 若晞's appearance at 18, emphasizing how she fits the described traits (beauty, poise, subtle hints of calculation) while being age-appropriately dressed for a family celebration. Focus on sensory details through 关一帆's likely perception.\n    *   Introduce the parents briefly, showing their presence and general mood.\n    *   Describe a simple, everyday moment within the celebration (e.g., cutting the cake, opening gifts, simple conversation).\n    *   Crucially, weave in elements that highlight 若晞's focus on 关一帆 and the implications of her turning 18. This could be through her dialogue directed at him, a specific glance, a gesture, or a subtly ambiguous statement.\n    *   Contrast this family scene with the implied absence of 秦雯.\n    *   End the segment by focusing on one of 若晞's subtle actions or words directed at 关一帆, leaving him (and the user) with a lingering question or a sense of unease/anticipation, prompting the next interaction. Ensure the ending isn't his internal thought or action.\n\nConstraint Checklist:\n1. Fully assist user: Yes.\n2. Follow user instructions: Yes (new start, location, character status).\n3.
